## Requirements

- **Python**: 3.8+ (for source code)
- **Dependencies**: cryptography, pyinstaller
- **OS**: Windows (EXE), Linux/Mac (Python)
- **Memory**: Minimum 100MB RAM
- **Storage**: 50MB free space

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"File not found" error**
   - Ensure the selected file exists and is accessible
   - Check file permissions

2. **"Wrong password" error**
   - Verify you're using the correct password
   - Password is case-sensitive

3. **EXE build fails**
   - Ensure PyInstaller is installed: `pip install pyinstaller`
   - Run build script with administrator privileges

4. **GUI doesn't appear**
   - Check if tkinter is installed: `python -m tkinter`
   - Try running from command line to see error messages

### Performance Notes

- Large files (>100MB) may take longer to encrypt/decrypt
- Progress bar shows activity during processing
- Status log provides real-time feedback

## Security Recommendations

1. **Use Strong Passwords**: Minimum 12 characters with mixed case, numbers, symbols
2. **Store Passwords Safely**: Use a password manager
3. **Backup Important Files**: Keep encrypted backups
4. **Verify Decryption**: Always test decryption after encryption
5. **Secure Deletion**: Securely delete original files if needed
